<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 6</span> Initiating Research</h1>
<p>Continuity Throughout the Research Process</p>
<p>Having access to analytics, statistics, computation, and biological expertise is important though being able to have simultaneous access to each of these professionals (assuming they are separate individuals) would be useful since no on individual has the “whole picture” and must frequently defer to another before being able to proceed. Initial consultations tend to center around design and general impressions about how to proceed though once the work proceeds questions naturally emerge in response to intermediate results that might require input from a number of people. Delays in response</p>
<p>This is particularly true when investigators are leveraging their network and/or past professional relationships in other departments or institutions. They do this because of lack of funding to adequately compensate existing staff unless of course funding can be found within K grants.</p>
<div id="estimating-effort" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Estimating Effort</h2>
<p>Investigators trust that self-declared experts are providing reasonable efforts and that they will provide analysis support (or someone from their lab will) although this hasn’t’ panned out or in a way that was expected. Consequently, effort has been obtained from whatever available sources possible. The PIF approach does help to initiate the research process and alerts the organization of an impending grant application. The advice one receives as well is generally good though the staff in place for Omics support may or may not be available for the project or have the up to date skills to address the issues. So the process works well administratively but relative to analytics, stats, and computation, there is room for improvement</p>
<p>Pre Project Planning –</p>
<p>This mechanism works well administratively but less so for matching with Omics aware personnel. The types of information coming from the Core is not sufficient and there is a need for ongoing consultation to better characterize the results. There is an understanding that the Core is not particularly prepared to offer such support but being able to point to a well -functioning relationship with the cores is essential.</p>
<p>We used project management to ensure project outputs and outcomes were achieved and all aspects of the project were planned, implemented, monitored and controlled. Sixteen of the researchers were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire for a post-project review. Project management is described as ‘a formalized and structured method for managing change in a rigorous manner’ [1]. It is used to ‘produce specifically defined deliverables, by a certain time to a defined quality, with a given level of resources, so that planned outcomes and benefits may be achieved’ [1]. It is also defined by the Project Management Institute in A guide to project management body of knowledge: PMBOK guide [2] (PMBOK) as ‘the application of knowledge, skills, tools, techniques to a broad range of activities in order to meet requirements of a particular project’ [2].</p>
<p>Grants –</p>
<p>K grants are plentiful and many faculty feel that there is adequate support and mentorship on how to get grants. The perceived problem is that to get an R grant requires preliminary data which is a problem given the problems with analysis. The projects under consideration do involve significant projects but there are on-going concerns about the existing environment being able to contribute to success.</p>
